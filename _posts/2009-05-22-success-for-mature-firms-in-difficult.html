Is it that matured IT and Consulting firms often loose track during difficult times?<br /><br />Probably yes. <br /><br />To understand this lets define what qualifies Maturity:<br />1. Differentiated Services to client - Creating multiple offering in the continum between Fixed Price deals Vs T&M deals<br />2. Sound business practicies: Sales, Financial, Contract/legal and economic factors....<br />3. Strong culture: Behaviors and attitudes deeply ingrained in its employees..<br /><br />A mature firm exhibits some of the above qualities stretched to the extreme that has defined their success in good times. (It reminds of the book Good to Great by Jim collins that I referred to see if there are anyother tenets we can include for the same, but lets keep it simple for discussion purposes as too many people critize a good work of Jim collins anyways saying it has a very high statistical bias......).<br /><br />The whole premise that they did well and matured to a certain level in providing goods and services in the past itself become their nemesis...they tend to stretch the qualities even in bad times when the context in which they operate has changed. Take for instance what we are going through under current economic conditions, everything: Inflation, Forex, COLA, employment, etc has become so volatile that for a large MNS/TNC it is almost impossible to meet their forecast with any reasonable probability....<br /><br />One very interesting insight I had too, is that some of these firms carry around the business with the same best practices even in circumstances like this without realizing how complicated their ways and means to profitability have become...This goes to an extent that they forget their past journeys on how simple, nimble and flexible their operations have been in the past....When the current environment requires them to really go back to the basics they had almost forgotten them or despise them as old habits that they believe are irrelevant! In the process they also become irrelevant in the market and forget what the customer/client really wants...<br /><br />One can Live through this nightmarish experience to understand the frustrations or learn from others insights...what has been your experiences?
