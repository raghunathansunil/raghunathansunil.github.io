A fundamental paradigm shift to build Mobile/Web apps explains the exponential downloads from Mobile dev. community. 

The power of layering framework/engine/Platform, DOM elements/styles compositions as widgets, their trees (Abstract-tree, concrete-object trees and render tree), State-context & constraint inheritance & notification, Depth-first box-constrained rendering & state tracking/rendering, platform embedding compatibility, and interoperability will make Flutter a powerful. 

The challenge will be on platform embedding layer with OpenGL (ES/WebGL), DirectX, Metal, Vulcan, and emerging graphic processing stds. The same is the case with interoperability. Here work-around will be to create p/f channels/FFI/plugins, vendor specific solutions like ANGLE & JS script.

We will see Flutter eclipsing other mobile frameworks: reactnative, Ionic, Phonegap, etc.

The choice of frugal platforms like parse is key to compete the likes of Cloud-platforms: Firebase/Amplify for server side play. It would be a wasted cause if privacy-preserving tech &  Tiny ML applications do not limit Server side computing need. 

Exciting CHANGE that will cut both-ways in times ahead!
