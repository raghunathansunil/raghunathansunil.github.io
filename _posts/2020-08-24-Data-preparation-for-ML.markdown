Regression/Classification: Basics for Standardizing (Standard/Robust scalars), Normalization (L1, L2 and Max) and cosine similarities. 
NLP: Count vectors, TF-IDFs, Wodembedding (Word-Vectors/Gloves), Bag of words/N-grams.  This can help build simple Chatbots

Sci-Kit is best place to jumpstart some quick models if we get the data. Alternately, generate synthetic data!
