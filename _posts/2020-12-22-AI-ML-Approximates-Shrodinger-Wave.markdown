Lost amidst Alphafold soundbite! Computationally intractable Electronic Schrodinger Wave function problem  for large atoms/molecules solved by collaborators with prediction accuracy >97%: Quantum Physics + Quantum Chemistry + AI/ML DNN Graph Neural net (also used in Alphafold), CNN. 

An exciting and interesting science problem solved by cross-collaboration of experts. A scenario where domain-centered modelling/problem-solving prevailing over a data-led problem solving. Its refreshing to see a non CV, NLP/Speech/ business optimization case getting the focus.

This breakthrough will lead to ubiquitous use of AI/ML in Quantum chemistry to model electronic properties of molecules with high accuracy, previously not possible....
