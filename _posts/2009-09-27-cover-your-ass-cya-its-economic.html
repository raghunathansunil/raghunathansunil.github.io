I've seen so many people gaining expertise in covering their own ass when it comes to protecting their jobs and status quo in organizations. It seems the more you reach positions demanding decion making. <br /><br />I've mostly seen lot of people out there who shy from making decisions and live through it consistently (good or bad). If decisions are forced upon them they lack the guts to own up the outcome especially when things go wrong. They usually seek refuge in adopting a stance, whereby they claim anything but their how bad their decision has been.<br /><br />How do you describe these behaviours?<br />1. You may simply blame it on the value system: Integrity, commitment, Authenticity, etc.<br />2. You blame it on their competencies, skills or experience?<br />3. You blame it on the social norm/culture of the position in the organization?<br />4.  You blame their id<br />5. You blame it on the externalities: Economic recession !<br /><br />I've often seen they exhibit all the above traits.<br /><br />How do you handle such people?<br />1. You avoid them!<br />2. You deal with them in a politically right way!<br />3. You fight them head-on!<br /><br />What choiced do you have to enable objective decision making in each of the above case:<br />1. Be straight present facts and figures to enable right decision.<br />2. Play their game and beat them at it, but objectively through facts and figures.<br />3. Become them and avoid contributing to any objective decision! BTW, who cares.<br /><br /><br />What would you do?
