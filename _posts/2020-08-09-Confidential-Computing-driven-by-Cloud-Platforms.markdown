Ensuring encryption in use will be the next leap to secure data & algorithms while being processed to avoid swiping data from memory (during processing) and reverse engineering code leading to exposed algorithm. Thinking beyond Code security, Data Encryption at Rest and Data Encryption in Transit.

Researcher and ISV/OEM have choice of implementing it narrowly or widely:
1. Narrow: H/W+S/W: Wide: Narrow+Algorithm (Homomorphic encryption  + Secure Multi Party computing ).
2. Narrow: H/w (Firmware tech) Wide: Narrow+S/W with limited H/w features.
3. Narrow: Generalized that is fully programmable. Vs Wide: Specialized with semi-programmable or none.
4. Narrow: Main CPU; Wide: Narrow+controlled processing Units.
5. Narrow: Cloud-Only; Wide: Narrow+On-Premise
