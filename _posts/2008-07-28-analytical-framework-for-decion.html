Having used the AHP and a simple linear graph to translate the AHP score to Onsite Offshore mix for a outsourcing solution in IT (some 4 years back), I realized the futility of the model premised on MECE criteria for the factors. On reading ANP (http://chern.ie.nthu.edu.tw/IEEM7103/937805-paper-1-may6.pdf) and weighted graphs, I was curious which of these technique is most suitable to determine the Onshore-Offshore mix for a outsourcing solution.<br /><br />ANP: This technique is better suited than AHP as it will consider the internal dependence and cross dependence between factors, the issue however is that it still does a pairwise comparision as we did in the AHP model within the cluster. But, usually some factors can appear in more than one cluster and can have interdependency.<br /><br />Weighted graph: The weighted graph model is better suited than AHP and ANP as it has the benefits of ANP, without ANP issues (factors interrelationship across clusters can be suitably represented).<br /><br />The scores we get from the ANP or weighted graph can then be used to transform into a onshore-offshore mix.
