Retail+CSP+Ecommerce convergence!. Its interesting there is so much options to appropriate consumer wallet share with their data :-)....

The tech-play use case from: 5G, AI, AR/VR, Qauntum computing will offer unfair advantages to early-movers. One of the quickest/easiest ways of winning business adventure/experiments is through eco-system partnership plays in FMCG, Retail/E-commerce, and Payment/Financial/CSP enterprises.

Facebook business adventures:
1.  Free internet service through internet.org that was scuttled by net neutrality activists & CSP.
2. Payment Gateway - Facebook Pay/Whatssapp Pay launch in India on hold due to data localisation non-compliance and competition: PayTM, GooglePay.
3. Facebook Business Social commerce ambitions already helping several niche family businesses to sell through product catalog on FB, offline financial and delivery channels.
 
Reliance business adventure:
1. Reliance Jio free data service!
2. Jio Payment Bank a struggling wallet service in competition with Phonepe-backed by Walmart
3. Reliance Retail, Not so successful EPOS program for Kiranans,  and its now JioMart.
