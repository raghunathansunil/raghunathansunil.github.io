Journey of Image recognition convnet architectures starting from LENET based on Convolution. The exponential growth post incubation period: AlexNet, ZFNet, GoogLEnet/Inception (module & Stems with Batch Normalization), VGGNet, Resnet (skip connection), XCeption, DenseNet, Residual Attention N/w, Mobilenet.....

All rooted on basic Convolution Neural Network.
