Lets look at some of the economic externalities/factors that impact a long-term pricing contract for IT Services (call it Outsourcing services):<br />1. Inflation<br />2. Cost of Living Adjustments<br />3. Foreign exchange volatility<br /><br />Some of the above factors can lead to Operating margin erosions to tune of 10-15% if they are not built and recovered. <br /><br />There are two ways in whic we can recover these costs<br />1. Engagement level: One by directly including it in every deal as part of the contract<br />2. Organization level: by currency hedging, managing cola & inflation internally through managed attrition :-)..<br /><br />I'm now curious now what is the Accounting regulations that will support on inhibit either of the above model. or are there really none...<br /><br />I've been struggling to get clarity on this and not being an accountant is a definite minus...Can someone help me here!
