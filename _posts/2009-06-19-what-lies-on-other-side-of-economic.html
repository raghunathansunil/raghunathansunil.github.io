The economic event of meltdown and slowing growth that we are witnessing today is unprecendeted in its nature in terms of the following:<br /><br />1. The scope of coverage (includes all the industries)<br />2. The scale (effects felt globally) unlike the prior Japanese, Argentinian currency crisis, Russian bond market initiated crash or the East Asian BoP crisis<br />3. The intensity/depth of effect it has had on the industry<br />4. The speed at which it propogated; virtually in 6-9 months timeframe it had affected the scope and scale<br /><br /><br />What lies on the other side of the unprecedented economic event horizon...No brownies for guessing it for the Financial industry as almost every one has seen and will see in terms of regulation, infusion and bailouts by governments, recapitalization, more stringent monitoring of risk exposure...read more of it in RGE Monitor an article written by NY Stern school of business. Lets look at our IT outsourcing market alone for a moment. I just happened to come out of a leadership meeting at work and was quiet amazed that every one claiming that the other side of the event horizon will be fundamentally different from what we have witnessed in the past...But no one knew what exactly what it really means :-)...either they thought we may not understand it or they themselves were not so sure.... I for one believe that they might've thought we would not understand it.<br /><br />The IT outsourcing industry has witnessed just one such downturn in Year 2000 & 2001 (Popularly called DotCom Crash) when the Telecom & Technology industry led downturn had immense impact on us (we will compare and contrast this in a separate post) . Having seen through that downturn and journeying through several organizations and roles, here are my insights:<br /><br />1. Client will demand <strong>more value</strong> (one can define it in many ways) to be delivered by Suppliers at <strong>lower cost.</strong><br />2. Client would demand <strong>transformation</strong> of their IT services/model/organizations leading to higher efficiency and effectiveness of IT support function at <strong>lower cost.</strong><br />3. Client would expect suppliers to <strong>bring innovations to life</strong> through IT services to businesses <strong>earlier, and faster</strong> than their competitors at <strong>lower cost.</strong><br />4. Higher <strong>performance/productivity levels</strong> (enforced through stringent SLAs) for thier businesses than before at <strong>lower cost.</strong><br />5. <strong>Better resources</strong> (may I call them Super-humans: higher talent, highly flexible, having shorter learning curves, working longer, etc.) at <strong>lower cost</strong>.<br /><br />Now if you do not understand whats and how of lower cost, it is immaterial you are best in any other tenet. Remember you still cant get a dime for your organization and find yourself running around amidst headless chickens or Heady humans ;-)...<br /><br />What has been your experience regarding these heads and your predictions on the other side of this event horizon?
