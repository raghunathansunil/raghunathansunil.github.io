What are the typical market characteristics that make an service/product a commoditiy? If we look at the economic theory one would try and understand the following constituents to answer it.<br />A. Price elasticity<br />B. Demand Supply curve<br />C. Marginal Value of service/product to customer<br />D. Nature & behaviour of stakeholders/participants/Seller-buyer<br />E. Sensitivities of the above to extraneous factors: Substitutes/complements, exchange rates, wage-inflation, change in resources/capabilities brought to bear for service/productetc.<br />If we reflect the current outsourcing market in terms of the above factors we may probably agree to it. What do you think? <br />If the outsourcing market has indeed become a commodity, what is the means by which big organizations can command profitable growth? Is it through one or combination of the following:<br />1.  Mergers & Acquisition - Inorganic<br />2. Innovation in Service offering - Organic<br />3. Innovation in resources (people, infrastructure, application, information) - Organic & Inorganic<br />4. Innovation in capabilities (Knowledge, organization, management, processes) - Organic & Inorganic<br />5. Others<br /> <br />Any thoughts. Feel free to share.
