 A hackathon in applying Ethereum in Customer loyalty with my colleague @dipayanbiswas in 2019. An interest rekindled with B2C marketing with Sovereign identities & B2B2C marketplaces and bunch of WEF SCM articles compels one to re-look few challenges that may take blockchain solutions a lifetime to materialize: 
1.  Issues: 0-1 game by blockchain P/f vendors, interoperability, hype/failure of Distributed Ledger Technology - DLT solutions, Data privacy/integrity, standards, access and corruptible-human-nature..
2.  Inability to monetize network effects positively. a.  trust issues in peer-peer market places (Example OLX),  b. permissioned & closed networks of centralized marketplaces (E.g.: amazon, Flipkart), c. unfair competitive advantages of participants leading market domination of decentralized marketplaces (E.g.: Udaan, Indiamart), and d. consumer & business behavior shifts due to extraneous factors (weather, pandemic) upending norms (E.g shift to Kirana when brick-mortar/digital marketplaces are shut!).

An interesting open source based DLT platform from IOTA holds a unique market-making advantages in the interim:
