COVID19 could change value appropriation for  aggregation players. 

Few Hypothesis:
0. The traditional direct, indirect and retail self serve models of FMCG will be even more valuable. 
1. Limited value for managing stocks for the Kiranas.  (Few players who had value multiplier benefits of Stock Management+a.k.a 3PLs (Transport agent/Delivery Agent) will be delivering 3PL value.)
2.  Few retail chains who were earlier appropriating value of a distributor either through marketplace or ePOS will shrink. 

FMCGs looking to incent existing Distributors/Wholesalers to expand their access through B2B marketplace may benefit in times where discretionary spend reduces for new initiatives and credit becomes king for kirana.
