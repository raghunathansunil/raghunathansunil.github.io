Interesting jokes from Neural AI generator trained on 2 layer LSTM 512 nodes 0.5 dropouts. The model was trained on Conan O'Brien (American late-night TV comedian) 7 year, 10K dataset.

A little dated but you could help build your own model from github and help train with your own dataset, but please be a good comedian if you are a dataset :-)...

Here is what I tried with multiple input text in quotes for completion, multiple trials and different variation numbers to get the below. 

1. If AI is the new UI then make me a product and a design from ..:-)...
2. If Data is the new Oil then they dont have a country.
3 If Every business is a health business then (there) are all the(se) problems!
4. If every business is a technology business then they want to see it with a ..:-)...

It was not always well formed/funny, but some really funny quotes cannot be typed here. I'm sure it will do a great job with narratives, visible emotion, body language and timing...

AI/ML has progressed with the tenacity and grit of dropouts: Entrepreneurs and nodes in dense-neural-nets %-)...
