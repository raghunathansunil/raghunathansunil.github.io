I read a very interesting article in Mckinsey: Industry trends in the downturn: A snapshot http://www.mckinseyquarterly.com/Energy_Resources_Materials/Steel/Industry_trends_in_the_downturn_A_snapshot_2264<br /><br />Quiet interesting for those of us in the High-technology industry to look at the trends…The IT spending as a trend has reduced 5 to 7 times that of GDP (With h/w 8-9 times and the IT S/w/Svs 3- 5 times)…The article sites the trend chart reasoning rather shallowly as contributed by high-spending in the Y2K and .Com boom…I completely disagree with this, having participated in both the Hardware, Software and IT services in my checkered Industry experience…Lets look at what has really been happening…..<br /><br /><strong>H/w 2001 hence</strong><br />In Hardware industry the prices has been falling the moment Industry revolutionized the Intel-based servers call it Titanium and/or multi-core technologies…I don’t see many proprietary server uptakes growing anywhere in the market…The commoditization of server has been doing extremely well to drive out the “Elephants who cant dance”<br />The processor is not he only driver to this trend…the trend is further supported by falling prices of Memory and memory access technologies…so you may use the additional terminology of “Economies of Scale”…Sorry Adam Smithsonians out there, I haven’t seen “diminishing rate of returns” yet…I attribute the reduction in cost driver to Innovation in Marketing first and technology next…<br /><br /><strong>Storage:</strong><br />In Storage industry too the price per MB/GB of storage has been constantly driven down…more than the commoditization of server it can be attributed to fine slicing of the storage segment for different application requirement of storage: archival, static, dynamic storage:<br />SATA/ATA disks vs the expensive SCSI disks<br />Falling prices of controllers<br />Falling prices of interface cards, and so on…<br />I attribute the reduction in cost driver in this segment to Innovation in Marketing and not so much the technology…<br /><br /><strong>Network & Peripherals</strong><br />There are 2 components that has been witnessing drop in prices one is the cost of communication equipments and the services associated with keeping these technologies up and running….some of the key developments contrivuting to these has been the following:<br />Falling prices of components to assemble network equipments<br />More efficient routing algorithms and efficient transmission of packets<br />Technology evolution both mobile and standard in transmissions (I may sound stupid rattling the technologies here without devoting a separate article on the topic backed by solid research: MPLS, ATM, FR, Ocnet, etc…)<br /><br /><strong>Software</strong><br />The greatest cost has been those of the reduction in license cost while increasing Product support and upgrade cost….<br /><br />The license cost has been going south facilitated by the following:<br />Innovative subscription models and SaaS…written by me in other articles<br />Piracy forcing vendors to reduce cost lest it is completely free<br />GNU & freeware (spurious ware)<br /><br /><strong>IT Services</strong><br />No doubt the factors reducing the cost are not just India and China, but also the promise of the COTS packages and the industry specific features that are requiring less effort to manage on the lon term…(I’ll cover this more in detail later)…you can get more view to it on my article under “Outsourcing” category<br /><br />Is there anything I’ve missed….share your comments and views on this…..
