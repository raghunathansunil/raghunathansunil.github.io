I read an interesting neuroscience research on how socail nature of humans define the high-performance in workplace....http://www.strategy-business.com/article/09306?gko=5df7f <br /><br /> I tend to agree part of the reasearch in my real-life experience. We often feel utter dispair in working in some environments where SCARF: Scare, Certainity, Autonomy, Relatedness and Fairness was absolutely lacking in one or more of these factors. We feel restless till we get out of the environment and it was quiet pleasing to realize that the author has put a well defined structure to understand why we feel so and why we avoid getting into such work environments....<br /><br /><br />However, What made me wonder is that if there is tolerance levels for each individuals to handle the lack of SCARF factors?<br /><br />In my view and insight it is "YES". Some individuals have higher tolerance levels to handle lack of SCARF factors in work environment. I guess they probably do the following to survive longer in the environment:<br /><br />1. <strong>Ignorance is bliss:</strong> They are highly people oriented and lack sharp cognitive skills that allows them to carry on longer in such environment purely due to lack of choices.<br />2. <strong>The Ventilator:</strong> They find equal minded people and socialize more to share their work woes with similar collegues and jointly vent out the frustration, which eventually allows them to sustain the lack of SCARF factor longer.<br />3. <strong>Fatalist:</strong> People accept that as their destiny and continue to work in such environments.<br /><br />What do you think?
