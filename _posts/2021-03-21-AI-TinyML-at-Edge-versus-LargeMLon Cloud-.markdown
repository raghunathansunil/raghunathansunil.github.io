TinyML provides a unique option to push ML uses cases to edge device for inference. The Large Cloud-based compute-intensive platforms will be required to train and build robust models. 

TinyML model will push for AI/ML model optimization initiatives, that would otherwise be slow to evolve. 

The challenge with TinyML models will be of handling the device accuracy- decay over time, model drift, and robustness of solutions due to changing data-characteristics. The distributed/federated AI offers a vaible solution to address such gaps over a period of time, but needs a complete shift in the overall architecure of such models. It will be interesting to see how the industry will emerge to solve new problems that will be created with edge computing.
