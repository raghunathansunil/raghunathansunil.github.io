<P id=dsyd0 style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in" align=center><FONT id=dsyd1 size=4><B id=dsyd2>Innovation Trends – A case study</B></FONT></P> <P id=dsyd3 style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in">We are often use Return on investment as a measure of efficiency of an organization. Let us try an take a look at Return on Innovation (ROIn) that companies may want to use to measure their innovation efficiencies. There are several interesting topics I came across recently on this topic, which sparked my thought process. The questions that arise in my mind:</P> <P id=dsyd5 style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in"><BR id=dsyd6></P> <P id=dsyd7 style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in">1. Why do companies invest in innovation? </P> <P id=dsyd8 style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in">2. How much do companies invest in innovation initiatives?</P> <P id=dsyd10 style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in">3. How does companies measure success of their innovation initiative?</P> <P id=dsyd11 style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in">4. Is there a potential business in outsourcing for innovation?</P> <P id=dsyd12 style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in"><BR id=dsyd13></P> <P id=dsyd14 style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in">In this, article we try and address some of these topics.</P> <P id=dsyd15 style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in"><BR id=dsyd16></P> <P id=dsyd17 style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in"><B id=dsyd18>Reasons for Investment in Innovation</B></P> <P id=dsyd19 style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in">Typical reasons often seen are:</P> <OL id=dsyd20> <LI id=dsyd21> <P id=dsyd22 style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in">Gain market share </P> <LI id=dsyd23> <P id=dsyd24 style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in">Increase profitability</P> <LI id=dsyd25> <P id=dsyd26 style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in">Long-term survival</P> <LI id=dsyd27> <P id=dsyd28 style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in">Others</P></LI></OL> <P id=dsyd29 style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in"><BR id=dsyd30></P> <P id=dsyd31 style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in">Of course, all the above are the most important in Pharmaceuticals, health-care and bio-tech companies. Off late one is seeing rampant invest across the industry spectrum for competitive advantage.</P> <P id=dsyd36 style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in"><BR id=dsyd37></P> <P id=dsyd38 style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in"><B id=dsyd39>Investments in Innovation</B></P> <P id=dsyd40 style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in"><BR id=dsyd41></P> <P id=dsyd42 style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in">The answer to this question varies from company to company. It is best to see what is the typical investment in R&amp;D for an industry group (similar set of companies) and compare it with how the company fares. Rather than looking at just the absolute R&amp;D investment figures (some companies do not report it and others do it just to capitalize on the incentives provided for R&amp;D such as tax breaks.). Some of the numbers we look at are staggering. NA companies spent USD 194.2 billion between 2005-2006 with a y-o-y growth of 10-15% (study conducted by Booz Allen and Hamilton). Other geographies are also quickly catching up as per the study. It is estimated that India &amp; china spend about USD 2.1 billion and growing at 25% y-o-y. </P> <P id=dsyd49 style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in"><BR id=dsyd50></P> <P id=dsyd51 style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in">But unfortunately, all spend do not necessarily translate to innovation. The recently published report from DSIR in India is a good indicator of the number of patent filed (since 2005) as a proportion to the R&amp;D spend for Automotive industry. For example Tata Motors ranks as number 4 in the Worlds most innovative companies in Business week, , their R&amp;D spend for the year 2006-2007 was USD 113 million (using Rs 43 per USD) and they filed 5 patents. Interestingly so TVS Motor company had spent USD 3.8 million and filed 29 patents.</P> <P id=dsyd57 style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in"><BR id=dsyd58></P> <P id=dsyd59 style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in"><BR id=dsyd60></P> <P id=dsyd61 style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in"><B id=dsyd62>Measuring success of Innovation</B></P> <P id=dsyd63 style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in">A very interesting study was recently published by BCG polling some 377 senior executives on measuring innovation. In this study only 28% of executives believe that they have received returns from investments on innovation. It is important to understand what are the key metrics that are used to measure innovation. This is best understood by categorizing these metrics as Efficiency, Effectiveness, and Size metrics (similar to the financial ration analysis category metrics we use):</P> <P id=dsyd65 style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in"><BR id=dsyd66></P> <P id=dsyd67 style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in"><I id=dsyd68><B id=dsyd69>Size metrics</B></I></P> <OL id=dsyd70> <LI id=dsyd71> <P id=dsyd72 style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in">R&amp;D investment as % of sales</P> <LI id=dsyd73> <P id=dsyd74 style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in">Number of patents filed</P></LI></OL> <P id=dsyd75 style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in"><BR id=dsyd76></P> <P id=dsyd77 style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in"><I id=dsyd78><B id=dsyd79>Effectiveness metrics</B></I></P> <OL id=dsyd80> <LI id=dsyd81> <P id=dsyd82 style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in">Net new revenue generated from new products/services (read innovation)</P> <LI id=dsyd83> <P id=dsyd84 style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in">Profitability attributed directly to Innovation</P> <LI id=dsyd85> <P id=dsyd86 style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in">Time to Market improvements due to Innovation</P></LI></OL> <P id=dsyd87 style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in"><BR id=dsyd88></P> <P id=dsyd89 style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in"><B id=dsyd90>Efficiency metrics</B></P> <OL id=dsyd91> <LI id=dsyd92> <P id=dsyd93 style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in">% Revenue generated from new products/services vis-a-vis existing offerings</P> <LI id=dsyd96> <P id=dsyd97 style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in">% Margin improvements from new products/services vis-a-vis existing offerings</P></LI></OL> <P id=dsyd100 style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in"><BR id=dsyd101></P> <P id=dsyd102 style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in"><B id=dsyd103>Trends in Outsourcing Innovation</B></P> <P id=dsyd104 style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in">Innovation outsourcing is not new, but lately one is monitoring and tracking it. US government has publishes a detailed report “Innovation in Global Industries” detailing this trend. To improve the innovation efficiency and effectiveness metrics companies look to outsourcing for innovation.
