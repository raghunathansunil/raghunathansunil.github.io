How do you influence objective decision-making in a group that has race/class/citizens prejudice?<br /><br />Thats a very interesting question, what will one do if he/she is challenged working with people across countries from different race to enable objective decision making. What will one do if there is a clear demarcation of racial undertones/overtones that one witnesses day in and day out localized to specific country/geography. what will one do if one believes it is an accepted social/organizational norm to play one-up race against the other or atleast subtle biases that clouds objective decision making? What will one do if he/she is unable to influence rational and objective decision making?<br /><br />I'm sure each one of us has faced the above situation working in cross-cultural setup.  (sure Mr. Obama you face it everyday as President so does the average common man like me somewhere in India facing it too in my realm). How do we handle such scenarios?<br /><br />1. Do we do something about it? If yes what are our options:<br />a. Should we be more assertive in influencing objective decision through facts and numbers?<br />b. Should we escalate within the organization through ombuds or similar such processes and draw it to management attention to set it right and stter towards objective decsion making? (well ofcourse we need to have all facts lined up to make a strong case)<br />2. Do we just read Geert Hofsted culture topology and then change yourself to be more "culturally" sensitive?<br />3. Or do we do nothing about it?<br /><br />I dont have answers just questions.....How have you handled such situations to enable objective decision making?
