The idea of architecture quanta as a single cohesive functional component defines the approach to decouple components and the consumer driven contract driving the coupling between the components. The parameters the drive the granularity of component based on functional cohesion, code volatility, scalabilty, fault-tolerance, & data security helps balance the right decoupling choice for service components. Architecture governance tools:  JDependency, archunit, chaos monkey, simian army are some great way to enforce arch. standards. A illustration to orchestration vs choreography to bind service workflows is compelling. A coupling with consumer driven contracts highlights the options for loose vs tight coupling options. 

A great summary of how persistence and sharing requirements drives the services coupling choices.  The balance of scalability & elasticity with EDA, Space based architecture and microservices sidecar patterns (Service mesh) summarizes the choice trade-offs.
