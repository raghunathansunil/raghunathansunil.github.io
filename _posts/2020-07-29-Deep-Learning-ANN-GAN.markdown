Deep Learning (ANN, GAN, LSTM, CNN, RNN, Policy Gradient, Deep-Q Learning,Transformers, BERT, GPT-3...) a better suited over ML (Regressions, Decision trees Randomforest, SVM) to expand solution space continuum with an ability to gracefully accommodate new information data scenarios.

Deep Learning Use Case Fundamentals where it started, but has wowed us already since 2012:
1. NLP (Chatbots,/Alexa/Chatbots/Siri): From Localized One-hot vectors word corpus to distributed word-vector for infinite corpus. The same stretched into Voice devices Google Duplex: Tacotorn, wavenet, concatenative TTS.
2. Images/DeepFakes: Using Generative Adversarial network that has 2 ANNs working counter to each other (one fake generator using latent space), discriminator and a real image. Example: Your aging timeline with current photo, changing a running cat to a tiger, a fruit basket of apples to oranges, making you invisible behind a moving curtain :-)...
3. Playing Games as a Master (Jeopardy, Go): Deep reinforcement learning with action in an environment with rewards and state transition.

Learning Deep to apply Deep Learning techniques in uses cases requires a strong foundation of Probability, Statistics, Linear algebra, Calculus, Optimization and Algos. ++ Graph Theory
