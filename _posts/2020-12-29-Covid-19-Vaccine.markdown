A hope lies ahead for many with a 30 mg Covid-19 vaccine of 2000 billion 4284 coded magic of ~1KB RNA information (or its alternative for many) against a virus of 7.5KB RNA information! 

Here is the summary of Pfizer-Biontech hack of fundamental architecture & code of life to deliver us this vaccine:

- 5 Prime UTR to define the ribosome landing zone to bootstrap and drive amino acid adaptor to generate spike protein
- 3 Prime UTR for its vaccine mRNA stability and expression.
- Psi molecule replacing U in mRNA to sneak into ribosomes without being destroyed and have long-life
- Proline seaters on mRNA to generate structurally robust  spike protein splints.
- The 30A's-10linker-70 A's combination to protect its degradation and functionality
