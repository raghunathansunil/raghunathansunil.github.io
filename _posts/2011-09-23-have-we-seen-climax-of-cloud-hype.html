Have we really seen the climax of Cloud hype already? Why do I think so?<br /><br />maybe they really underestimated data privacy, control and ownership issue on one hand and the passing of contractual risks through liablity and idemnity clauses for data protection...that will hinder growth of cloud...<br /><br /><br />so what about the high decibel and hig frequency campaigners of cloud have to say now....<br /><br />1. IAAS: Data center consolidation....maybe we are likely to see the MIS glass house again...maybe now they just call MIS glass house with some dynamic provisioning of servers :-)..<br />2. PAAS: are we seeing the ISVs attempt to get back in business by trying to repackage themselves as provisioning a platform fizzled out...sybase now repositions itself as mobility ISV...oracle Forms/repoorts moving into open platforms with eclipse and java-based solutions...maybe force.com doesnt have all that horsepower as it claimed it did...nobody knows whats up here another 1-2 years down the line...<br />3. SAAS: we just have SFDC here....others are all our classical hosting solution providers...maybe oracle ondemand, SAp are all trying to reinvent themselves...maybe they are failing in ERP III :-)....for those who saw MRP I, MRP II, MRP III really renamed themselves to SCM....no idea where this is headed....I'm not sure if anyone is really ready for a multi-tenant, pay-per-use kind of offerings for enterprise systems yet....<br /><br />What is all the fuss about utility computing through cloud? we are not going to see IT becoming like a power utility company split based on generation (H/w: IBM, HP, SUN,; S/W: Oracle, Salesforce.com, SAP, N/W: Cisco!!), transmission (ISPs and telecom service providers) and distribution (???)....and businesses out there dying to hire them on rental service for what they use....it seems to me most businesses are not even sure the value they are getting from such IT systems anymore....<br /><br />What do you think?
