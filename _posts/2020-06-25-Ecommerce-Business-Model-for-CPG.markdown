The analysis indicates Wholesale (e-retailer) model for High Contribution Margin-CM and High Growth, but D2C for High CM long-term. 

But,
- HBR D2C article predicts 98% of D2C businesses closing down and a 10 year old idea. Very few success cited other than Nordstorm or Casper, both of which play in the customer of 1 segment for their products.
The wholesale model would mean value working with MTs and LMTs with strong fulfillment and distribution network. The challenge will be the pressure on CM due to bargaining power depending on network strength & size.  

Net-Net, the Marketplace model seems a hype curve with no long-term ecosystem value. The marketplace will have to emerge out of just transactional focus (profitability and consumer growth) and risk-outsourcing to manufacturer-CPG (brand, promotion, quality and safety).  Its important to think partnership/ecosystem play for branding/promotion/value-addition.
