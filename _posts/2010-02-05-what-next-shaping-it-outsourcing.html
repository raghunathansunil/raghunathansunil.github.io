We have seen  some interesting differentiators used in winning outsourcing deals in the last decade:<br /><br />Technology based<br />1. Communication/Connectivity technologies<br />2. Internet technologies<br />3. Emerging technologies????<br /><br />Event based<br />1. Y2K<br />2. Dot.Com<br /><br />People-based<br />1. # of graduates (engineers)<br />2. Talent pool<br /><br />Business/Economic based<br />1. Manufacturing -> Services<br /><br />Quality based<br />1. Quality certifications leading to claims on Industrialized/factory model for delivery<br /><br />Cost based<br />1. Labor arbitrages<br />2. Factor costs based on countries<br /><br />Risk based<br />1. Shift and degree of accountability and ownership changes<br /><br />What is the next dominating set of factors that could (re)shape the IT outsourcing industry?<br />- Politics (Regulation, taxation of outsourcing industry, and other trade impediments)<br />- Economics (Inflation, Exchange rates,....)<br />- Social structures (Free agents as opposed to employees of organization, ???)<br />-????
