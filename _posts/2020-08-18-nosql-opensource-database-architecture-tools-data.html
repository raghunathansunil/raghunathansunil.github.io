<div><p>Cloud Platforms (AWS/Azure/Google/Amazon) offer a range of non-hierarchical, non-RDBMS databases services (not necessarily No-SQL): Wide-Column, Document, Time Series, Graph, and Analytics. Powered by opensource, and launched on cloud platforms, these have seen a growth of 52% in 2019, with projected revenues exceeding 25% by 2022.</p><p>The next-gen cloud-native application architectures and the hunger for data variety for Analytics/AI will drive adoption of these data management services rapidly if one understands the underlying algorithms, architecture and design principles. Here is a compendium of the same:</p><div class="slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width"><img alt="No alt text provided for this image" data-media-urn="urn:li:digitalmediaAsset:C5612AQERFnP0zi0zJQ" src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C5612AQERFnP0zi0zJQ/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1598104724099?e=1615420800&amp;v=beta&amp;t=uAOBBaASc1oWuAL_Dwkk4YkJZu5TMXxVpXquFzraX08"></div><p><strong>Data Interchanges - Added 7th Sept 2020</strong></p><p>Traditional and bulky interchange - Services/WS/RPC/streams/messages/events/Actor-based for data pipelines: JSON, XML, CSV. May not be a best choice for data intensive apps working over n/w. Fast-forward and consider these options:</p><ol><li>Protobuf: If you are thinking RPC as interchange mechanisms and potentially gRPC</li><li>Thrift: Social streaming with facebook</li><li>Apache Avro: Opensource for Hadoop and large data, order agnostice (writer vs reader schema)</li></ol><p>The challenges in all the interchange formats is to take care of implementing the forward and backward incompatibilities.</p><p><strong>Architecture: Replication, Partitions, Transaction - Added 9th Sept 2020</strong></p><p>Distributed data bases will be increasingly common as we head to cloud. Its important to understand and account for the challenges while devising applications/algorithms:</p><ol><li>Replication challenges and solution:</li></ol><div class="slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width"><img alt="No alt text provided for this image" data-media-urn="urn:li:digitalmediaAsset:C5612AQHp4MRVI5UD5A" src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C5612AQHp4MRVI5UD5A/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1599634591825?e=1615420800&amp;v=beta&amp;t=_uPBxQNnjwzStI2r34dIRY9m3TpRD35pXeIlUti_U-E"></div><p>2. Partitioning/Sharding: Horizontal scaling enabled by Key based, hash-based, primary/secondary index based, etc. The challenges are primary around need for rebalancing and routing, they are solved well by many large databases efficiently. </p><p>3. Transaction: Applications have to account for inconsistent implementation of Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability properties. This leads to Dirty reads, Dirty writes, lost updates, read/write skews (timing anomaly). The hard problem are solved by offering solutions that applications need to implement: Snapshot isolation with "BEGIN TRANSACTION", materializing conflicts with "SELECT FOR UPDATE", and Serialized isolation methods: poor performing Serial execution (REDIS), poor scaling 2-Phase locking (MYSQL using predicate, range-index, shared &amp; exclusive locks), the latest Serializable snapshot isolation (PostGres) where conflicting writes are isolated.</p><p><br></p></div>
