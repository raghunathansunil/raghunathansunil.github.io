4.3 trillion combinations possible in a rubic cube. If one knows what he/she is doing it can be solved in 25 moves....<br /><br />Isnt the above a amazing method to solve the Rubics madness. <br /><br />But you can't apply the same method to winning a chess game, can you? <br /><br />Methods have their limitations when applied to a problem. Not all problems can be solved through methods. Typical failures can occur under following circumstances:<br /><br />1. Incorrect definition of problem<br />2. Applying the wrong methods or methods wrongly<br />3. Deriving the wrong conclusions of resolution<br />4. Underestimating the complexity and power of execution<br />5. Carrying rationality of thoughts too far!<br />6. Underestimating the intangibles! <br />7. Many other countless reasons.....that I've not listed<br /><br />Dont you think a typical undergraduate can apply collection of methods to solve worlds hunger then?
