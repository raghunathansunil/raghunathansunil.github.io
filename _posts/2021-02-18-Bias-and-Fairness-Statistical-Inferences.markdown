A tool to analyze data biases and decision fairness from google: <a href="https://pair-code.github.io/what-if-tool/learn/#analysis"> What-if. </a> <br>

Statitics provides "Confusion matrix" to capture the stochastic process/system inconsistencies from real-world observations. Decision-makers have a choice to attribute right wieghtages to Type-1 False Positive or Type-II false negative sampling error and choosing the right choice of fairness metric: equal accuracy, equal opportunity, demographic parity. 

All this is simplified for analysis and decision making with the what-if tool. 

Humans are incapable of making the right data-driven decion making when the data-features and volume of same is high. The decision is often defered to the highest pecking-order in the organization hierarchy,  which does not lead to fair decisions. 

Next, time any decision needs to be centred on available data please rely on a AI/ML tool to predict the outcomes, use confusion matrix and before all that run your training data first with what-if tool!
