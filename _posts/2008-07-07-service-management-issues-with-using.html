The service provider often finds it difficult to agree to a SLA right-away due to several constraints:<br /><br />1. Lack of clear baseline/benchmark for the service prior to outsourcing due to several factors:<br />a. Absence of management of service through metrics<br />b. Absence of structure, processes and organizations <br />c. Absence of system and measurements<br />d. Absence of right data in the systems (even if it is available)<br />2. High client expectations on improvement targets during outsourcing. This results in defining the target metrics at a level which the existing service organizations has failed to achieve<br /><br />If clientsâ€™ services are matured and above constraints are not a bottleneck, then the challenge shifts to the following:<br /><br />1. Characterization of demand (read as service requests)<br />2. Characterization of service (read as resolved service requests)<br />3. Planning the right capacity for providing service<br />4. Defining the optimal service level objectives for the lines of business and hence the service providers<br />5. Designing the right capacity-demand model to serve the clients<br />6. Executing and sustaining the performance of the organization to the defined service level objective, and<br />7. Continuous improvement on services to the clients and their lines of business<br /><br />Do you agree? What other problems have you faced?
