Chatbot - one of the oldest envisoned use case in AI, in FMCG-Retail for SCM-Logistics and CRM- Marketing,Sales and Service gets less soundbytes and initiatives during C-19 when its need was felt.

Few probable ecosystem reasons: 
1. Negative press on failed chatbot use cases.
2. Fragmented Chatbots platforms: 175+ operate in this space spread with features combinatorics in the category sets:  programmable, GUI, API, multi-lingual, specialization types (RPA, service, pure-play), for enterprises. 
3. Multiple channels solution that lack consistent, & standardized branding offering and designed for entertainment purpose. Eg: Voice: Echo,/Siri/GA/Crotana. Messaging: Twillio, Whatsapp, FB Messenger. Web app etc.
4. Reliability of NLU algoritms and data sets.  LUIS, NLAPI/AUTOML, Comprehend and  virtual agents from Speech-Text: AWS Polly, Cognitive service API, Google APIs, Polly/API
5. Deployment platform options of Lex, Dialogflow, Bot service and others like saleforce who brand bundles.
6. Lastly, no significant ROI due to poor bot business KPI posting on GCR, FR, Bounce rates, user retention/satisfaction.

The above has resulted in non mission critical internal system-of-records solutions than system-of engagement/intelligence solution.
