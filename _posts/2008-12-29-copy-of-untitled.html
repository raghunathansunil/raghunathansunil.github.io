Quiet interesting to view these trends by positing them on the curves....I was quiet amused when I was reflecting on my journey through school where I was so obsessed with AI and NLP...Thanks to my internship in one of the premier R&amp;D center and few Terminator type movies, I was able to see through the disillusionment :-)...<BR><BR>Its a worthy exercise after all!<BR><BR>For more reading on this topic visit : http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/awc-futr.htm#adoption <BR><BR>Its time well-spent I would</FONT></SPAN><BR>
