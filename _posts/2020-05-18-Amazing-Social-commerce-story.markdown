Few implications on FMCG-Retail-E commerce businesses: 
- Consumer community driving collective bargaining. Challenges Trade promotion practices where10-30% of investments made to drive sales uplift.
- Kirana and long-tail rural consumers the next 6m outlet enabled by breaking trust-deficits (returns & payments). Challenge in last-mile delivery.
- D2C models enabled but challenges in role of Outlets and Distributors who may loose current business.
- Drive ecommerce adoption from 1% to 10-15% for High-volume-Low-Value products. Challenges in enabling a multi-principal model.
- Consumer data pipeline enabled for personalization, but privacy issues.

Few interesting views on whether the model can be replicated outside China:
1. Partnership  with Payment providers, principal & their distributors , 3PLs/Transporters...
2. Thin-line on Gaming vs Gambling mechanics  - Potential regulatory/societal concern
3.  Culture dimensions: Individualism vs. collectivism (IDV) Vs Indulgence vs. restraint (IND)

Lockdown expermients proves, this model is already works for Perishable goods: Vegetables & fruits in pockets.
