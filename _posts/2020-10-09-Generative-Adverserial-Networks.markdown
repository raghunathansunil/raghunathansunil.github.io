Vue.ai, glamst & Modiface exciting use cases for online shoppers.  Artbreeder is absolutely imaginative for art lovers. 

Interesting concepts/intuitions to apply in wide use cases: Nash-Equilibriums (Generative and discriminator function), competitive gradient decent and disentanglement. Synthetic data generation to remove training data bias (the most important diversity issue to champion in AI world!) and overfitting issues. 
 
GAN evolution and popular algos to know: ProgressiveGAN (Better image quality) ,StyleGAN (Subtle variation on generated images based on specific attribute), CycleGAN (mapping images from one-domain to another), StarGAN (Multiple style variation images from a single input image),...

Future areas to watch out for: Styles, texture, 3D in medical & industrial use cases a
