<DIV>This is an interesting&nbsp; question that has been nagging me for a while. I've been designing and delivering IT solutions for clients across the globe: Americas, APAC and EALA geographies. I got inspired by Geert Hofsted works on assessing culture of different countries based on the 5 dimensions: Power-distance, Individualism, Masculanity, Uncertainity avoidance and Long-term orientation. While, these dimensions may or may not (followers of Brendan Mcsweeney&nbsp; and Ailon G articles cannot agree less) be relevant or even correct in the current context, but still provides a sound perspective to compare culture across countries. Another interesting observation I noted after reading these articles is that the Occupational culture is not the same between employees within the same organization. Ofcourse, one could argue as McSweeny did; where the organizational culture across nations may still not be the same.&nbsp; My thesis here hinges on challenging the fact that Occupational culture differences between nations for IT services segment and also that fact that I worked in multiple organizations transcends the premise that it is unique to an organization culture as well!. So give these premise and the belief that national culture does exist and is homogenous, lets look at the patterns I saw in IT solution design and delivery.</DIV><br /><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><br /><DIV>The IT solutions that are designed and delivered across different countries seem to have some pattern that further elaborates the "uncertainity avoidance" dimension of Hofsted. I got a Self Reference criterion (SRC) whenever I look at some solution designs and sometimes even search for these traits in the IT services execution. In my SRC, I have abstrated few dimension that characterizes IT solution design and delivery.</DIV><br /><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><br /><DIV>1. Engineering/Structure: In this dimension, we see how the levels of engineering for a solution design and delivery varies from low to High. Generally we have seen German ways to design and delivery is high leading it to be too complex. On contrary we see the other extreme, bieng the low engineering and design and delivery of IT services to be low for India. </DIV><br /><DIV>2. Clarity: The amount of clarity (scope, outcome/deliverables, schedules, efforts, etc.) required to design and execute the solution seems to be high for typical European client than the american or APAC clients. This can be construed in other ways to minimize the unfacourable outcomes and the propensity to tolerate ambiguity.</DIV><br /><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><br /><DIV>&nbsp;Are there anyother dimensions that you have witnessed? I'll be happy to hear it.</DIV><br /><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><br /><DIV>I'm not sure we can give a quantitative score for each of the above attribute for each of the country. It may be a worthy exercise to pursue. The study result can be put to use effectively in devising a solution for clients in the geography. What do you think?</DIV><br>
