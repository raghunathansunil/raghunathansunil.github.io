The objectives of managing the service (any service Consulting, System Integration, Application Outsourcing, etc.) through application of innovation techniques are to reduce the cost to service. It is critical for one to understand the constituent factors that influence cost to serve goal. The following diagram crisply captures the factor trees that influence the cost to serve goal.<br /><br /><a href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_yagrmqvHLAs/SICW48RohPI/AAAAAAAAAAk/P2ozwLH-nlg/s1600-h/Cost+to+serve.JPG"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_yagrmqvHLAs/SICW48RohPI/AAAAAAAAAAk/P2ozwLH-nlg/s320/Cost+to+serve.JPG" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5224341472746702066" /></a><br /><br />Now we can capture the difference in the estimate/forecasted cost for each of above <br />parameters, measure the actuals during execution and drive management and control to minimize the differential.<br /><br />Our transformation intiatives can be focussed on reducing the estimate/forecast cost in the first place...we'll dvelve more on this topic later...<br /><br />Any thoughts on what factors I might've missed
