Evolving an objective function is riddled with multiple factors making it increasingly difficult for one to establish an objective function. Typical factors of an objective function are: </P> <P class=MsoNormal id=k8xc2 style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0.25in">  </P> <P class=MsoNormal id=k8xc5 style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">1. Onshore-Offshore percentage </P> <P class=MsoNormal id=k8xc8 style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">2. Choice of delivery location to perform the services in an outsourced environment</P> <P class=MsoNormal id=k8xc9 style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">3. Composition of workforce to perform service delivery (managers, Analysts, Software engineers, etc.) and their cost</P> <P class=MsoNormal id=k8xc10 style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">4. The number of shifts designed to perform service delivery</P> <P class=MsoNormal id=k8xc11 style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">5. And several more (not sure what I'm missing here)</P> <P class=MsoNormal id=k8xc12 style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0.25in">  </P> <P class=MsoNormal id=k8xc15 style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0.25in">  </P> <P class=MsoNormal id=k8xc18 style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">Modelling based on the above factors results in devising an objective function next to impossible. In this context I     was considering two approaches for the same: </P> <P class=MsoNormal id=k8xc21 style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0.25in">  </P> <P class=MsoNormal id=k8xc24 style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><B id=k8xc25>Approach 1</B>: Why not we consider all the above factors and design one single objective function.
