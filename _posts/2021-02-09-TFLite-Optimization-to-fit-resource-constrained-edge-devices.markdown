TFLite brings in power of deploying AI/ML on resource constrained edge devices that lack memory, computing horsepower, storage and lacks floating point processing capabilities. All this with a small tradeoff on accuracy.

- Pre-Training and Post conversion quantization
- Size and Latency based optimizations

This is democratization of AI/ML deployments on edge contrary to thinking about cloud platforms.
