Imagine the choice of trust exercised by individuals at their discretion to business entities: Shops/ Establishments/ Companies/ Enterprises for a selective transaction of their choice and withdrawing it through a immutable timed self-expiry or a specific individual action. 

Key Technology Enablers: HyperLedger Indy, 5G, Mobile Wallets, Payment gateway enablement, P-Commerce (P-Commerce: Reach out over Inmail for more discussion on this), Promotions and discounts

Few Challenges to think about:
1. What will happen to the business entities obsession to chase Consumer personal data?
2. How will Privacy Data/regulations change for the transient sharing of data?
3. What happens to the current industries that thrives on usurping personal data through cookies ads scripts to grab our data?
4.  How will be the aggregator economics-value appropriation dynamics change  and viability in such a scenario? How will they resist this?
5. What happens to data for narrow AI/ML without data? 


Imagine a new future that can be shared from here!
