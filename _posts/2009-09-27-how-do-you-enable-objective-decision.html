You may surely have faced similar situation at work. Especially in societies where collective (to be more precise hierarchical) decision making is prevalent.I'm sure you would've seen war movies where decision making follows hierarchical protocols and the people on the ground suffer (eg. US war in Vietname, war in Iraq) where 1000's of foot soldiers loose their life and/or limb abiding decision made by a general somewhere out there who knows nothing abt ground realities.  Sometimes the decision making realm has lot more complexities and dynamics that are difficult to comprehend superficially (i'm sure there are lot of superficial leaders out there!). What do you do in such circumstance?<br /><br />1. Try to remedy it: <br />a. You give your bosss the context, facts and apprise him/her of the complexities involved in making the right decision and let him/her solve it?<br />b. You enable the right decsion by giving appropriate choices to choose from (well ofcourse only if your boss is a listening type?)<br />2. Do nothing about it:<br />a. Just wash off your responsibilities and let your boss make the his/her own decision and live through it whether it is right or wrong? Ofcourse you suffer on the field, but you do it anyways if you choose option 1 above :-)...<br /><br /><br />All the above make you realize how futile being objective and pragmatic is in real-world! <br /><br />What would you do in such situations? What course do you choose?
