In Dealing with Darwin book Geoffrey A. Moore brings a great menu of innovations types that can be applied by organizations operaing in different market/growth phase of their respective industry...<br /><br />Let me trace the growth of Indian IT Services Industry and the innovations that were so effectively applied over 2 distinct phases:<br />Early 1980-2000: The Indian IT Industry was in the growth phase and if we look at the dominant innovation themes was that of Disruptive innovation of Offshoring.  The primary participants here were TCS, Wipro, Infosys, PCS, IBM, and HCL-HP<br />2000 onwards the IT Service industry is quickly become that of a mature market: The dominant innovation themes used in customer intimacy zone were: marketing Innovation and experential Innovation. The marketing innovation was to provide different types of services AM, & AD and within them Fixed price, capacity and T&M models. The experential innovation was to provide services to client businesses on SLA and KPI. The participant in the industry were still TCS, Wipro, Infosys, IBM, HCL-HP and we saw new emerging MNC like Accenture :-)...<br />On the operational excellence zone it was a combination of Process Innovation and off late Value engineering and Migration innovations.  The process innovations were the ISO, CMMI and so on. ALl participants in the industry have adopted this innovation which resulted in these cores actually becoming the context. Very few organizations graduated to the value engineering and Value migration innovation like TCS and Wipro by adopting 6-Sigma and Lean management practices....But there are some fast followers..<br /><br />Now all the above innovations have actually been adopted and replicated very quickly by other resulting in these cores actually becoming the context...Now every client looks for their service provider to have adopted and assimilated these innovations. Hence performing on Quality, offshoring etc. only gives a neutral or negative outcomes to service providers and definitely not positive :-)...<br /><br />The question of what is really the core of the services offered by IT services companies...I really dont know....I've been struggling to figure this out myself...the core it seems really lies in the unique culture of the organizations and in specific domains of IT service like in embedded engineering etc. we'll dvelve on this topic later...but you can reach me through the comment section if you are interested in discussing this and application of the 5 model core-context repurposing strategy...<br /><br />It is also interesting to understand what will a new player getting into the market operate on in the mature market. It definitely has to be a disruptive innovation...where will this disruptive innovation come from:<br />1. Marekting innovation/Experential innovation in the customer intimacy zone: For example:  Cost, price innovations like outcome based pricing, variable margins, etc.<br />2. Integration, Value Engineering, Value Migration/Process Innovation in the Operational excellence Zone: Usage of automated tools or operating model to provide a unique benefit to the client....<br /><br />Or a combination of the above two...It would be good to think about this <br />Interestingly we see that the market has not gone into Declining market yet...so I'll reserve discussing this for later...however we have seen some organizations may soon reach this phase if they are in niche/commoditized service areas like AM where only the bigger players can survive the challenges by sheer scope and size....<br /><br />Well my thoughts are flying in a zillion directions right now....maybe i'll structre it better with more insights....watch out this space for more....
