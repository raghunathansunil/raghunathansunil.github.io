Guru speak:
- Generalist attitude takes you further away from Code
- Architect is as much leadership as about developer mindset
- Live long enough on a platform to realize consequences of your architecture decision

Architecture styles:
- Monolithic architecture simple and cost effective: Layered a classical NCA of 1997s, Modular architecture still relevant SAP/Oracle Ebiz, Microkernel architecture - aka Salesforce platform and products.  Strange many commercial product discount this and fall prey to Microservices architecture!
- Distributed architecture never simple or cheap!: Microservices architecture, Service based arch. (different UI styles for modules that coexist),  SOA (never to use even for heterogeneous system workflow orchestration!), Event Driven arch.  (apps responding /reacting to services or workflow tasks), and space based architecture (never heard..  for transaction system with cached memory involving processing units and virtual middleware grids for messaging, data, process and deployment)

One can combine architectures for specific problem domains.
