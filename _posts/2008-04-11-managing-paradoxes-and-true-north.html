The Strategy Paradox by Michael E Raynor: This is a 2007 best seller under the Business &amp; Strategy topic. I was reading and viewing discussions at some contemporary topic in Davos World Economic forum, including Mark Fosters Chief Executive of MCIM Webcast from Swiss Airport on EMM (Emerging Market Multinationals) the next spin of Multi-polar world. I thought ACN thinking on the next phase of Multi-Polar world reflects so much of what Michael E Raynor talks about in his book on how success or failure of even the best company lies in their ability to maintain strategic flexibility. For those of us who have read “The Blue Ocean strategy”, “Innovators Dilemma” and “Good to Great” ; this book seems an anti-climax. According to this author, even the best thought out and executed strategy fails, due to small changes in the industry/business ecosystem, he explains this with powerful case studies of product failures. I enjoyed this well-researched book and thought you would like it too.<br /><br />Bill George – Thought Leader Interview by Amy Bernstein:  Are you comfortable under their skin? Do you like yourself?

Or coz’ you had difficult life experiences and hence bound to be a great leader? Are you just trying to emulate someone or some organization leadership style? If the questions and answers interest you, read the attached thought leadership interview with Bill George. I remember reading the book review sent by my colleague on “True North” few months back…never managed to see it on the roadside yet so I think I can’t afford to buy it yet…but this excerpt here is from the author of True North- Bill George former CEO of Medtronics. In summary, there are 5 successful leadership characteristics: Pursuing purpose with passion, practice solid values, lead with their hearts, establishing enduring relationships and finally demonstrates self-discipline. Read this and think abt it next time you hear the word “leadership”. Maybe this leads you to your epiphany..J….
