With negative OM and shrinking net income 99mil primarily due to strategic investment gains... Certainly planning to continue retaining CRM market share lead with 18.4% (TAM of ~100billion as per IDC 2019) which is still 60 bps ahead of SAP, Oracle, microsoft and Adobe combined...

Interestingly, it took so long for salesforce to establish itself as a no 1. platform business along with other category...though not clearly specifying in 10-q what it includes...we know certainly it excludes sales, service, commerce and marketing and includes industry aquisitions vlocity/appexchange, and its ISV acquisition like heroku,  mulesoft, tableau, which could be  making  that difference ðŸ˜€....

Reviewed 2019 gartner (multiexperience and low code app platform) and forrester (app development and delivery and digital experience) establishes them in leaders quadrants....one can see sap, oracle and adobe also in leaders quadrant in digital experience dev. platform, and with Microsoft in low code app devl. platform...it seems like winner of marketshare will be decided by analytics/AI/ML play and the FOSS based open platform economics!
