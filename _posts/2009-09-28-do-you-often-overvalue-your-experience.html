I strongly believe we overvalue our experience, knowledge, skills...rather simply anything that can be defined as measure of success in society :-)...I do that often and to some extent knew it too whenever I encountered my frailities. I got a rude awakening to it when I read the book Irrationally predictable" and some of the works of Daniel Kahnemean and Taversky....<br /><br />But, why do we do this and how do we avoid it? Lets answer the first part of the question:<br /><br />1. To gain social acceptance.<br />2. To prove to the people we know and sometimes want to know to build a superior perception of us.<br />3. To get an expected treatment of ourselves or to achive the higher gaols we set upon ourselves in society, workplace and so on....<br /><br />How can we avoid it?<br />1. Accepting the fact that our measures of success is relative. Its all a matter of anchoring ourselves to the right individuals/groups and our position/status quo in a society is relative.<br />2. Constantly, reminding ourselves that the workings of this world is far more complex than that appears on the surface or at our levels of understanding.<br />3. Reading more and more about topics that we know we know too little about!<br /><br />How do we handle such people at work?<br />1. Pamper their ego: Just give it to them...let them reach the self-realization on their levels! Atleast, you please their ego and let him/her be happier in their own perceptions :-)<br />2. Probe them to discover if they really know what they think they cliam to know....<br />3. Netural approach, just listen to them. Most of the time you are never entitled to your opinions or maybe the other person is a poor listenet!<br />4. Remind them that one knows far less than what one thinks and if possibel quote them to "predictably irrational" and works of Daniel Kahneman :-)...<br />5. Prove to them you know much more than them...hee hee...you bet this is something that will please your ego!!!<br /><br />We may choose a combination of options...not really restricted to one...Whats your view?
