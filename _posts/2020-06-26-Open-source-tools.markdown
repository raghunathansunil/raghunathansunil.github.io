1. Active and passive reconnaisance tools can pretty much get any information out there on web about individuals, groups and entities: Shodan, Recon-Ng, theHarvester and Maltego
2. Any individual or entity with website can ooze so much information about their internals to allow a techie to hack their site: Wpscan, whatweb
3. Entire website can be crawled by Spiders to siphone email, meta-data, configuration files etc.: Burpsuite, Skipfish, ZAP
4. Tools can help in scanning vulnerabilities for web sites, mount attack , record vulnerability and report: Nikto, Burpsuite, ZAP, OpenVAS...many others  for free.

There is no limit to excitement & fun for a script-kiddie when you use these tools in combination to expose vulnerabilities. 

Exploitation of the vulnerability needs a different order-of-magnitude stealth & skill. 

Interesting times for the hackers and anarchists as one accelerates towards cloud!
