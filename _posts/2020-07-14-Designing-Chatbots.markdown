a great read though 3 years old...Covers the entire spectrum of the following:
1.  Type (Super vs Domain specific) and purpose of bots for task, Information, alerts
2.  Branding of Bots
3. AI: NLU, Conversational,Image recognition, Prediction sentiment analysis. 
4. Interaction features: Voice/Image/Text/template/links menus/commands. Concept of Flows, Intents, dialogs, entities
5. Context and memory capabilities driving interactions across multiple spectrum
6 Development methodology involving discovery, Conversation scripting and solutioning unique/different from traditional cycle followed by NLP training/Tokenization/Knowledge base building and exception handling
7. Analytics & data to train and improve AI models
8. Integration/Tools/API/SDK  to connect with enterprise apps

It falls short of technology framework, architecture and critical feature analysis of the commonly available tools.

It also misses some popular use cases and the limitations of chatbots for mission-critical applications.
