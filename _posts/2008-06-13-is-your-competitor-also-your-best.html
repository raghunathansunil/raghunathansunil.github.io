There are very businesses that have their greatest competitor as their complement as well. One can see this more pronounced in the Enterprise software segment that I looked at.  Let us look at some interesting successful organizations that are both competitor and complement:<br /><br />1.Windows-Oracle<br />     a. The largest market share for Oracle database is on Windows platform, but Oracle competes aggressively with Microsoft in the database segment MSSQL Vs Oracle.<br />     b. Oracle Accelerate solution competes with Microsoft NetDynamics, Axatpa, & their insignificant other acquisitions<br />2. Windows-SAP: They sing a duet with SAP enterprise software running on Windows, but they compete as well Microsoft NetDynamics, Axatpa, & their insignificant other acquisitions and SAP Business One.<br /><br />Seeing the above some interesting question arose:<br /><br />1. How can you uncover the complement in your competitor?<br />2. How do you nurture such relationships for economic value while fighting in the market place?<br /><br />To answer the first question maybe it helps to look at the ecosystem and value networks in which these organizations operate. <br /><br />For the second question, it is about execution of well strategized Go-to-Market initiatives (as we popularly call them in the Partners & Alliances world). <br /><br />Any thoughts/experiences you want to share on thisâ€¦.
