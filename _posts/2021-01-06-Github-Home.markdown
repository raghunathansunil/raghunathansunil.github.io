A new simple beginning, launching my Architect-Developer First github home (Free and open Source) to collaborate, share and engage to solve problems. It just took 1 day to build a basic site with Jekyll. But, as one said, There is no compression algorithm for experience.... 

Tried several options  earlier, but missed the simplicity and ease of working: 
Blogspot-> Entered in 2006 for blogs great features, but limited flexibility to version and share codes. 
Linked-In: Posted several viewpoints and articles, but struggle to version and archive.
Twitter: Share tweets & fleets but 280 is too small to get across ideas.
Slack: Newsgroups type medium is good but only for cohorts; and if group becomes big you get lost.
Whats app: Great for group collaboration but difficult to handle and track discussions.
