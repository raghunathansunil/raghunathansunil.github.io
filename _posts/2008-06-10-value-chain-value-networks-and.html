Value networks is an interesting way to analyze a firms ecosystem and the context in which it operates. This cant be more pronounced in anyother field than in the High-technology industries where products/services have a very small shelf-life, time to market for innovation is short-spanned and almost anything is quickly cloned and commoditized.  Few questions arose in my mind:<br /><br />1. Is it true then that in this hi-tech industry realm no copyright, patents or licensing can give market protection for economic value exploitation by innovators?<br />2. Is the only way for organization to capture the maximum economic value then rest on ability of the organization to exploit the value chain to maximize its value capture (by doing things like build strong brands, scale quickly to meet imcreasing consumer apetite, agile to create several new innovative product/service parallely, produce highly reliable products...and so on)<br />3. Given the dynamics of the emergent players in the value chain and its ecosystem can one capture better value by constantly and dynamically capturing the changes in the eco-system through value network diagram? (Here I'm impressed by erstwile Sun Microsystems CEO Ed Zander who later moved to Motorola, whereby he said that he revives the organization strategy everyday...)<br /><br /><br />I happened to read some interesting articles on value networks from the site http://www.value-network.com where several cases are posted on how value networks (bubble charts) are detailed to capture the roles and exchanges of players in the ecosystem and how this with System Dynamic Modelling (swirly charts) captures the interactions and influences of the players. I was partticularly impressed by the case on Boeing not for the depth of the article or the details on how Value Network analysis and System Dynamic modelling is effectiveley used to test several aircrafts models, but for the ability of the organization to continuously pioneer/adapt such interesting models like DSM, Lean, Six-sigma and so on without inventing them :-)...It sets a precedent and a desire for everyone to adapt it in their own context....<br /><br />It has now thrown open a zillion ideas in my mind on how Value networks, System dynamic modelling, Constraint theory/Optimization models, Queuing systems can be juggled to solve complex daily business problems like SLA management, Recruitment, delivery management...if only i can get an opportunity to prevail upon my desires in the mundane corporate world....
