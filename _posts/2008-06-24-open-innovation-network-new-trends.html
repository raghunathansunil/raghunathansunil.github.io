Interestingly, I had a chance to look at two Open innovation networks sites of P&G and Innocentive last week are raised a question on the longevity, impact and value of these networks on my blog article: http://insightful-journey.blogspot.com/2008/06/open-innovation-networks-does-it-have.html<br /><br />It was interesting to see Mckinsey Quarterly article on "The next step of open Innovation article" yesterday taking an agnostic view of Open network and potraying an Uncertain future. I really believed Mckinsey had a foresight on what will be the next step of Open Innovation networks! While, I was disappointed on not getting the right answer from Mckinsey :-) (as usual) but atleast it provoked me to think ahead on what trends can emerge out of Open Innovation networks<br /><br />1. Consumerism and mass customization will reach a tipping point. This will force companies to produce unique product/service that caters to needs and wants of just one customer at a time (Read the latest Prahalads book on Co-creation where he mentions this as N:1 scenario)<br />2. Companies will be forced to reshape/redesign/realign their resource and capabilities dynamically to meet "A" customer need & want (R:G case in Prahalads co-creation model)<br />3. Shifting of paradigms where value capture will be premised on how networked and closely knit a company is in its eco-system and how quickly it can leverage it to deliver on customers need & want (My own thesis!)<br />4. Shifting of organizations P&L centricity from product/service lines to customer (Similar to what is happening in Telcos & Utility companies)<br />5. Emergence of new sets of business laws & practices: stakeholders, privacy, ownerships, contracts, IP....??? (My own thesis)<br /><br /><br /><br />Any more trends that you think of and can suggest?
