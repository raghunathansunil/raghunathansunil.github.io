Definitely yes...If you thought ponzi schemes are prevelant only in Capital markets you may be wrong...havent you heard of the latest Ponzi scheme run by Madoff ripping off $ 50 billion in corporate debt markets and becoming the undertaker (not an insurance jargon plz...i'm getting tierd of those at work) of few hedge funds exposed to corporate debts!<br /><br />There are few in IT, let me name some of these schemes:<br />1. Offshoring <br />2. Productivity gains<br />3. Quicker return on IT investments<br />4. Zero transition cost<br />5. Transformational IT engagements<br />5. Lower TCO<br /><br />hee hee i wish I can go on for some more....I'd love to elaborate on this further...wait and watch this space in the coming months....let us see what it all throws up...
