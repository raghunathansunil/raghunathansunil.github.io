NLP Illustrations are interesting commercial use cases for E-commerce:
- AutoML &  AWS Comprehend
- Amazon S3, Athena, Redshift, Parquet formats for ingest ECR for hosting, EMR for spark cluster analysis, and Step functions for deploy
- DeepU scala library for Data quality, constraint verification and recommendation,
- Rating use case with BERT and Reinforcement learning (Contextual Multi-Arm Bandit) for personalized recommendation.

This contrasts with Google clouds opensource tools: DataProc, Data fusion, Anthos+GKE, DataFlow, BigQuery,.... 

The next big race will be on MLOPs: 
1. explainableai services which will become core of every Google offerings. Limited coverage on AWS Sagemaker Debugger service which claims to provide similar service...
2. multicloud , there is no clear offering from AWS unlike Google's Anthos
