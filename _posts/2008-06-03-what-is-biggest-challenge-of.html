Any transformation or change management exercise in an organization involves high stakes and poses significant implementation challenges. Any change management initiative should start first by appreciating (read understanding) the stakes, the stakeholders and their current challenges well.  The definition and design of the change management initiative then factors this understanding into it and creates an actionable plan. All that a general gyan!<br /> <br />What is the biggest challenge one faces in executing a transformation/change management plan:<br />A.Hard areas: Identification of methods, tools, techniques, frameworks, analytics (such as performance KPIs), etc.<br />B.Semi-Hard areas: Organization structure, existing processes, etc. that are changing as part of the change initiative<br />C. Soft-areas: Human behavioural- fear, emotion, passion of existing process, NIH syndromes...etc.<br /> <br />I believe the biggest challenges are often in the Soft areas which is often under-appreciated/attended. Are their frameworks or techniques or structure that one can be used in that area?. I'm looking for some things that could be used generically across engagements such that it can be applied for a fool-proof transformation/change management exercise.
