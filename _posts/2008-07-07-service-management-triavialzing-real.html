The entire service management model can be based on simple Server-queue modeling concepts. <br /><br />Model Factors<br />The minimum factors that one needs to understand of the client service management context for an item in the service catalogue are:<br /><br />1. Service type and the associated processes are activities that contribute to transforming the inputs (a.k.a problem/incident) to a acceptable/predictable outcome (a.k.a resolution/work-arounds)<br />2. Service scope (Level 1, Level 2, Level 3)<br />3. Service domain (Business, Application, Infrastructure, Tools, etc.)<br />4. Service locale (process such as supply chain, HR; functionality such as order management; and technology such as Java, .Net etc.)<br />5. Severity and Priority within each level (such as Sev 1, Sev 2, Sev 3, etc.)<br /><br />For the above service context one needs to get the following measures to model the service:<br /><br />1. Total number of service requests (classified across the above dimension) over an interval of time. (Lets define this as )<br />2. Number of service request resolved and closed (classified across the above dimension) over the same interval of time as in point 1. (Lets define this as )<br />3. Number of service request as backlogs (Lets define this as Lq)<br /><br />Simple Server-Queue Model concepts<br />Based on the above factors a simple server queue model as identified in the figure can be applied:<br /><br /><a href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_yagrmqvHLAs/SHIwB3-7M3I/AAAAAAAAAAc/Pt_SwHBu1F4/s1600-h/untitled.bmp"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_yagrmqvHLAs/SHIwB3-7M3I/AAAAAAAAAAc/Pt_SwHBu1F4/s320/untitled.bmp" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5220287726841705330" /></a><br /> <br />The simplistic model is premised on the following:<br /><br />1. the mean-arrival rate has a passion distribution (established statistically through a goodness of fit test such as Kolmogorov-Smirnov test), <br />2. the service rate is exponential in nature (established statistically through a goodness of fit test such as Kolmogorov-Smirnov test),<br />3. All requests are homogenous in nature,<br />4. All service is homogenous in nature<br />5. Service is rendered on First Come First Served basis (FCFS)<br /><br />But note that this is seldom the case and is a gross over simplification of real life scenarios. However, one can best understand the characteristic behavior of a model in its simple form.<br /><br /><br />What say you?
