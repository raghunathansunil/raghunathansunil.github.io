There is so much hype and hoopla about Cloud computing and Service Oriented architecture....as I had earlier mentioned in my earler article that these are going through the peak of Inflated expectation (thanks Gartner for this nice terminology other than the Magic Quadrant)....<br /><br />If you have been long enough in the IT career say 10-15 years you can see through it nothing differently than Inflated expectations...<br /><br />Remember the great hype and Hoopla created at every phase of an Innovation:<br />a. Midrange computers challenging the Mainframes: The SUN & HP of thw world giving the IBMs of the world the run for their money...it all seemed to be a great hype on midrange as Intel based servers today are giving the midranges run for their money...<br />b. RDBMS challenging the Network and Hierarchical DBMS: Remember the Oracle/Ingres/Sybase/Informix/DB2s of the world giving the DEC and IBMs databases run for their money...we also brefly saw Object oriented Databases momentarily sending sparks and fizzling out<br />c. Client server architecture challenging the Mainframe screens/C cursors/the Windows SDK fat clients: Remeber Oracle, Powerbuilders of thw world giving the gargantuan and complex Windows SDKs run for their money...all to be challenged again by the internet thin client frameworks...we saw a full circle here...<br /><br />What is a pattern we see in all the above...it seemed that they are really reinventing the wheel or coming a full circle...I'm unable to articulate this much better, but let me try and give this simple analogy...its like the earht going around the Sun year after year in a clocks precision...I dont really see the Cloud computing any different from retracing the Mainframe era....and the SoA going back to the very fundamentals of what the technologies and methodologies exit for to run a business with what you have rather than buying new technology to support the existing business....<br /><br />So whats so great about the SoA and Cloud Computing...not coz' i', not chasing them this time...it all seems to be a good marketing gimmick...what has to be innovated in the technology space has really been innovated and it is just about putting the old wine in a new bottle or just plain message in a bottle ;-).... it seems its all about the context and not really the core....<br /><br />What do you think? Just a hype and Hoopla around cloud computing and SOA...Whata the big deal?
