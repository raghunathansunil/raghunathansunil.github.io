The Project Natick (deep sea DC), Project Palix (DNA inspired storage) and Holographic storage  experimentation is amazing. 

Some great uses cases in store with the here and now of Azure platform services:

1. Infrastructure: 
a. Energy efficient Power Usage effectiveness focus with disaggregated high-density rack architectures, 
b. DWDM for networks cable efficency and Azure Orbital GSaaS service tor each remote locations for connectivity, FPGA based disaggregated NICs
2. Platform Tranpiler to accelerate development/deployment:
a. Bicep transpilers to build  ARM templates.
b. FPGA transpilers to generate Verilog/Systemverilog optimized code
3. Application Services
a. DapR REST/gRPC API based support for microservices
b. Open Service mesh alongside support for CNF tools like Linkerd/Consul/Istio
c.  Atlas Serverless compute enabled to run on containers on baremetal through PilotFish initiative.
4. Confidential computing (partnered with Intel SGX) and Confidential Ledger services.
