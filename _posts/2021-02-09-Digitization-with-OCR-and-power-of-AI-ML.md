Digitization with OCR created more than 20 years back without any AI/ML algos, but gathered dust for many years for compelling business uptake. Many of them have fine-tuned (with Table and Image acces)s and python-API-enabled for programmatic use.

Strangely, the AI/ML LSTM based OCR like Tesseract with NLP, RPA and workfloes can enable exponential adoption of use cases across industries. 

The real enabler in each of this is open source projects and breaking the proprietary software/cloud-platform-lockins.
