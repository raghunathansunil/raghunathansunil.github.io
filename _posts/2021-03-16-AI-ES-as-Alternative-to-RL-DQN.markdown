Evolution Strategy presents a good alternative to RL DQN for games like Atari and Human Exoskeleton systems. All this without needing a SGD algorithms, which is arguably not the model how humans intelligence works. 

All popular AI/ML is primarily dependent on backpropogation algorithms for optimizations and a refreshing new method is worthy alternative.
