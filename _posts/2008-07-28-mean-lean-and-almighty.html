Is 6-Sigma the answer to managing the Cost of Poor Quality for IT projects?<br />Thats a mean sales gimmick...by just staring at the UCL and LCL for metrics and then determining the means and reducing the variability does not lead to reducing the CoPQ.<br /><br /><br />Is Toyotas Production System abstracted as Lean management a panacea for IT services productivity?<br />It is a pretty interesting question, and its answer depends on whom, when, how and with what intent you are asking. <br /><br /><br />Can applying any of the above method lead to 30% IT productivity?<br />Maybe Almighty can answer this!<br /><br /><br />Is it better than using Agile methodologies for Software development?<br />The answer to the above, in my opinion is fairly easy for anybody who is seasoned in the IT industry and has dealt with a typical SDLC/V-Process model for their Software products' development.
