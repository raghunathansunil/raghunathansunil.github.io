Low-Code No-Code SaaS platforms in USD 5 -20 per user per month are great innovation to empower business to build apps from data, configurable UI flows and cloud deployments. 
At the moment, the market is crowded with too many products from the former-BPMS and Data players.
Its strange analysts dont seem to agree on parameters to identify vendors consistently. 

These application offer choices for enterprises to build bespoke industry/functionality specific composite/web/bespoke/Business user specifc applications at 1/5th of the subscription cost of Salesforce, build& deploy apps in few hours unlike weeks and much lesser upfront SI costs. 

While the leader emerges and dust settles, it seems like a good strategy for startups & SI to partner & build offerings/composite applications using these platforms rather than limiting to 1-2 popular SaaS CRM/HR/OM vendor.

BPMS Vendor: Pega Infinity, Appian, ...
DB centred: Caspio, Orale APEX
Pure-play: Filemaker, Quickbase, Appsheet, Creator (Zoho). Kintone, Kony, Powerapps, visualbuilder, ousystems

One can consider opensource tools Apache Cardova, Airflow and Databases to build SaaS platform in  months, if you have time and avoid paying subscription fees or dont like their constraint/opinions.....
