Is information assymmetry one of the biggest Innovation impediment?<br /><br />My hypothesis is Information assymmetry can inhibit:<br /><br />1. Innovating new product/service<br />2. Taking innovation to the market for economic benefit<br /><br />It is often the case that innovative ideas do not come to the fore not coz' it is not potent to produce economic benefit, but more so coz the innovator does not have a method to its madness to tap it for econmic profit. <br /><br />Some case in point:<br />a. Toyota did not invent innovative cars when they started off. <br />b. Dell did not invent innovative personal computers. <br /><br />All they did was copied a FORD/GM or cloned IBMs innovative thoughts and exploited them to economic profit through ingenious process innovations. They did that as they knew that some of the methods when cross-pollinated in their industry can aid them in reaching far-fetched profits (which other wise would not be feasible). They exploited the information assymmetry of the existing companies in uncovering  customers unmet need and applying these techniques/methods to economic profit.<br /><br />Another way of looking at information assymmetry, I've seen countless number of cases where an innovative idea never reaches the light of the day due to several reasons:<br /><br />1. Inability of a technologist to understand markets/customers well (case of Palm PC)<br />2. Inability of a marketer to understand a technology and its capabilities (cant get a case right-away bit can get back to this later...)<br />3. Inability of an innovator to understand legalities leading to loosing a patent and hence commercial benefit....<br /><br /><br />The cases could be innumerable. Whenever one understands and plugs these information assymmetries we have often seen successfull enterprises generating great economic benefit not only to its stakeholders but to the society at large...<br /><br /><br />Do you agree/disagree? Any interesting insight of yours!
