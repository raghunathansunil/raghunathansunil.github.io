COVID19 adversity opens a D2C opportunity....(quite powerful... miles to get to your money for a EComm or D2C some numbers....and  lot more deeper to go....): 

- China: 70%  of demand from 30% of land mass of country ...Still big!
- India: 70% of demand from 55% of land mass of country
- US: 70% of demand from 11% of land mass of country.

Now, another interesting note for FMCG penetration of Ecomm in Groceries in 0.1% with so much more more to go and Ecomm alone will not solve for....
