My single stop for articles & teweets.  Prior to this, there was no easy way to collaborate and share my posts/articles, accelerators and code easily from mutiple social/local tools.

The Github site was created with standard Web (HTML, css, js), PHP, Git repo, and Jekyll utility in a day. The focus of the website is to share content with simple navigation rather than the design elements.

* Home: The current folder
* Blogs: Point of view and articles
* Twitter: Twitter feeds
* Projects: Project that I'm currntly working on
* Blogs: My viewpoints.
